Usage
-----

To install unity versions form this cask simply tap this repository

```bash
brew tap wooga/unityversions-beta
```

Now you can install any version hosted as cask with

```bash
brew cask install unity@2017.1.0f3
```

-or-

```bash
brew cask install unity-android-support-for-editor@2017.1.0f3
```

Unity will be install under `/Applications/Unity-$VERSION`. You can install multiple versions at the same time. All support packages will be installed in the parent Unity directory. Means:

`unity-android-support-for-editor@2017.1.0f3` --> `/Applications/Unity-2017.1.0f3/PlaybackEngines/`
